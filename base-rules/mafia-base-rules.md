## Strategy Tips

### For Townspeople:
- Pay attention to voting patterns and who defends whom
- Be careful about revealing special roles too early
- Trust your instincts but verify with logic
- Work together to catch inconsistencies in stories

### For Mafia:
- Coordinate targets to eliminate Detective and Doctor first
- Blend in during discussions
- Create plausible alibis and suspicions
- Don't defend fellow Mafia too obviously

### For Detective:
- Investigate suspicious players early
- Share information strategically (revealing too early makes you a target)
- Keep track of confirmed Town members
- Consider lying about your role if necessary

### For Doctor:
- Protect yourself early if suspected
- Try to protect likely Detective candidates
- Mix up your protection targets
- Remember you can't protect the same person twice in a row
