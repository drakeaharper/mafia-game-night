# Werewolf Game Rules

## Overview

Werewolf is a social deduction game where players are divided into two teams: **Villagers** (good) and **Werewolves** (evil). The game alternates between night and day phases. During the night, Werewolves secretly eliminate Villagers. During the day, all players discuss and vote to eliminate someone they suspect is a Werewolf.

## Objective

- **Villagers win** by eliminating all Werewolves
- **Werewolves win** when their numbers equal the remaining Villagers

## Setup

- **Minimum players:** 7 (odd numbers work best)
- **Recommended:** For 15+ players, add one Werewolf per four additional players
- Each player receives a secret role card
- One player acts as the **Moderator** who runs the game

## Roles

### Werewolves (Evil Team)

**Werewolves** (2+ depending on player count)
- During the night phase, Werewolves open their eyes and silently choose one Villager to eliminate
- Werewolves know each other's identities
- They must coordinate their target choice without speaking (pointing, gestures only)

### Villagers (Good Team)

**Seer**
- During the night, the Seer points to one player to investigate
- The Moderator signals thumbs-up if the target is a Werewolf, thumbs-down if they are a Villager
- The Seer's goal is to gather information and guide the village without revealing their identity

**Doctor**
- During the night, the Doctor selects one person to protect
- If the Doctor's choice matches the Werewolves' target, that person survives the night
- The Doctor can protect themselves

**Villagers**
- Regular players with no special abilities
- Must use discussion, logic, and voting to identify Werewolves
- Their voice and vote are their only weapons

## Game Flow

### Night Phase

1. Moderator announces: "Everyone close your eyes and go to sleep"
2. Moderator awakens each role in sequence:
   - **Werewolves**: "Werewolves, wake up and choose someone to eliminate" (silently point to target)
   - **Doctor**: "Doctor, wake up and choose someone to protect" (silently point to target)
   - **Seer**: "Seer, wake up and choose someone to investigate" (Moderator signals result)
3. All players return to sleep
4. Moderator notes what happened during the night

### Day Phase

1. Moderator announces: "Everybody open your eyes; it's now daytime"
2. Moderator reveals if anyone was eliminated (or if the Doctor saved them)
3. **Discussion period** (recommended 5 minutes):
   - Players discuss who they suspect
   - Players can accuse others
   - Accused players get 30 seconds to defend themselves
4. **Voting**:
   - Players vote on who to eliminate
   - Majority vote determines elimination
   - Ties can be broken by revote or Moderator decision
5. Eliminated player reveals their role
6. Moderator checks win conditions, then starts next night phase

## Win Conditions

- **Villagers win:** All Werewolves are eliminated
- **Werewolves win:** Werewolves equal or outnumber remaining Villagers

## Strategy Tips

### For Villagers
- Pay attention to voting patterns
- Notice who accuses whom
- Don't reveal special roles too early
- Use logic and deduction

### For Werewolves
- Act like normal Villagers during the day
- Don't obviously coordinate with other Werewolves
- Deflect suspicion onto others
- Try to eliminate the Seer and Doctor first

### For the Seer
- Don't reveal yourself unless absolutely necessary
- Guide discussions subtly using your information
- If you find a Werewolf, build a case carefully

### For the Doctor
- Try to protect likely Werewolf targets
- Don't reveal yourself early (you become a target)
- Protect the Seer if you suspect who they are

## Moderator Tips

1. Keep track of:
   - Who is alive/eliminated
   - Werewolf targets
   - Doctor's protection choices
   - Seer's investigations

2. Maintain consistent timing so players can't deduce roles from how long night phases take

3. Don't give away information through facial expressions or tone

4. When the Doctor saves someone, announce: "Someone was attacked but survived!" (don't reveal who)

5. Consider using background music or sound effects to cover any accidental noises during night phases

## Common Variants

### Alpha Werewolf
- One Werewolf is designated as the Alpha
- If investigated by the Seer, the Alpha appears as a Villager

### Cupid
- On the first night, Cupid chooses two players to be "lovers"
- If one lover dies, the other dies too
- Lovers can be on opposite teams, creating interesting dynamics

### Hunter
- When eliminated (day or night), the Hunter takes one other player with them

## Number of Werewolves by Player Count

- 7-8 players: 2 Werewolves
- 9-11 players: 3 Werewolves
- 12-14 players: 3-4 Werewolves
- 15-17 players: 4 Werewolves
- 18+ players: 5 Werewolves

*Adjust based on experience level and desired difficulty*
