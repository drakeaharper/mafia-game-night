- **GM:** "Death Eaters, close your eyes."

#### Step 2: Dumbledore Investigates

## Winning the Game

### ORDER WINS
The Order of the Phoenix wins when **all Death Eaters have been eliminated**.

### DEATH EATERS WIN
The Death Eaters win when they **equal or outnumber** the remaining Order members (at this point they can control all votes).

---

## Strategy Tips

### For Order Members:
- Pay attention to voting patterns and who defends whom
- Be careful about revealing special roles too early
- Trust your instincts but verify with logic
- Work together to catch inconsistencies in stories

### For Death Eaters:
- Coordinate targets to eliminate Seers and Healers
- Blend in during discussions
- Create plausible alibis and suspicions
- Don't defend fellow Death Eaters too obviously

### For Dumbledore/Mad-Eye:
- Investigate suspicious players early
- Share information strategically (revealing too early makes you a target)
- Keep track of confirmed Order members
- Consider lying about your role if necessary

### For Hermione:
- Protect yourself early if suspected
- Try to protect likely Seer candidates
- Mix up your protection targets
- Remember you can't protect the same person twice in a row

## Game Example (10 Players)

**Roles:**
- 3 Death Eaters
- 1 Dumbledore
- 1 Hermione  
- 5 Order Members

**Night 1:** Death Eaters target Ron. Hermione protects Harry. Dumbledore investigates Draco (Death Eater). Ron survives (not protected, but Death Eaters chose someone else would make this wrong - let me fix this)

**Night 1:** Death Eaters target Ron. Hermione protects Neville. Dumbledore investigates Draco (Death Eater). Ron is eliminated.

**Day 1:** 9 players remain. Dumbledore subtly suggests Draco is suspicious. After discussion, players vote to send Draco to Azkaban. Draco is revealed as a Death Eater.

**Night 2:** Death Eaters target Hermione. Hermione protects herself. Dumbledore investigates Pansy (Death Eater). Hermione survives.

**Day 2:** GM announces someone was protected. Dumbledore now knows two Death Eaters. Players discuss and vote out Pansy.

**Continue until one team wins...**
