# Mafia Game Night

A digital companion app for managing in-person Mafia/Werewolf games.

## Overview

Mafia Game Night helps you run smooth, organized Mafia games at your next gathering. The app handles role distribution, player management, and game flow while keeping the social deduction fun of in-person play.

### Key Features

- **Server-based Architecture:** Run the server on your desktop/laptop
- **Mobile-Friendly Admin Interface:** Control and moderate the game from your phone
  - See all player roles and alignments at a glance
  - Mark players as eliminated/alive during gameplay
  - QR code generation with network IP support
- **Digital Role Cards:** Securely distribute roles to players
- **Player Management:** Handle joins, waiting states, and game progression
- **Multiple Game Variants:** Support for classic Mafia and themed variants
  - Classic Mafia with standard roles
  - Harry Potter theme with custom fonts and themed roles (Death Eaters, Dumbledore, Madam Pomfrey, etc.)
- **Real-time Updates:** Players and admin see updates automatically (5-second polling)

## How It Works

1. **Host starts the server** on a desktop/laptop
2. **Game Master creates a game** - selects theme and configures player count
3. **Players join** by scanning QR code or entering game code
4. **Game Master issues role cards** - system automatically assigns roles
5. **Players receive their role cards** privately on their devices
6. **Game begins** - Game Master can see all roles and mark eliminations as the game progresses
7. **Player statuses update automatically** - eliminated players see their status change in real-time
